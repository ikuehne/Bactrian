INTRODUCTION:

    Bogoscheme is an interpreter for a simple Scheme-like language.  The
    language and implementation are changing rapidly and primarily intended as
    an instructive project, so the language will mostly go undocumented for the
    moment.

USAGE:

    After cloning the repository, simply type:

    $ make

    to compile.  OCaml, ocamllex, ocamlyacc, and the Core standard library are
    required to build bogoscheme.  The resulting executable will be amusingly
    called "bs".  It will display a message and prompt when run.  An example
    session:

    => (define x 10)
    ->> #u
    => x
    ->> 10

    "=>" is the default prompt, and "->>" indicates a return value.  '#u' is the
    unit value, which is returned from statements that do not produce a value.
